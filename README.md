# the Lovelies
Web application for the Lovelies acoustic cover band. This project's purpose was to learn several web development concepts, such as user authentication, database management, RESTful API development, as well as a general understanding between front- and back-end development. Technologies used were NodeJS, AngularJS, jQuery, and various node packages and frameworks.

## Disclaimer:

  This application is being written for personal experimentation and to learn various node.js technologies and web development practices, as well as providing a website for my fictitious musical group, The Lovelies. As such, you should not be surprised by any mistakes or poor coding choices.

 * AngularJS - models, views, controllers, directives
 * Node Package Manager - install packages, build scripts
